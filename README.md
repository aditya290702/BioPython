# BioPython
Biopython is a Python toolset for bioinformatics, enabling tasks like sequence analysis (DNA, RNA, protein), file parsing (FASTA, GenBank), and sequence alignment (e.g., BLAST). It also provides access to databases (NCBI, PubMed) and supports phylogenetics and population genetics, aiding genomics and proteomics.
