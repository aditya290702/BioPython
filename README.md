I have used Biopython for various bioinformatics tasks, including performing sequence analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein, parsing file formats like FASTA and GenBank, and conducting sequence alignments with tools such as BLAST. Additionally, I have used it to access biological databases like NCBI and PubMed, and worked with phylogenetics to build and analyze evolutionary trees, as well as handling population genetics data. It has been instrumental in efficiently managing bioinformatics data and performing computational analyses in genomics and proteomics.
